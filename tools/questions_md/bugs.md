- **Bug reports**<br>
  Please make a small and self-contained program which exposes the bug, and then open an issue at the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/stjaeckel/quadriga-lib">Github repo</a>. The small program should have 
  a main() function and use only functions/classes from Quadriga-Lib, Armadillo and the standard C++ 
  library (no other libraries). We appreciate your time to make a bug report. 

- **Who are the developers?**<br>
  Lead development is done by <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://sjc-wireless.com">Stephan Jaeckel</a>.

- **Can you implement features on request?**<br>
