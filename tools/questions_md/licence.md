  any software that incorporates or distributes Quadriga-Lib in source or binary form must include a

  attributions can be placed in the documentation and/or other materials provided with the software.

- **How is the Apache License related to the GPL?**<br>
  The Apache license and the GPL are completely separate and distinct licenses. Unlike the GPL, 
  the Apache license does not "infect" your source code. See also the comparison of open-source 
  software licenses on Wikipedia.

- **How is the Apache license related to the MIT and BSD licenses?**<br>
  The Apache license is a permissive license similar to the MIT and BSD licenses, but also provides 
  a grant of patent rights from contributors to users. As such, the Apache license can be thought of 
  as an improved version of the MIT and BSD licenses.

  No. We just use the Apache license.
