%SUBDIVIDE_TRIANGLES Subdivides the faces of a triangle mesh into smaller faces
%
% Description:
%   This function splits the triangles of a mesh into smaller triangles by subdividing the edges
%   into 'n_div' sub-edges. This creates 'n_div^2' sub-faces per face.
%
% Input:
%   triangles_in
%   Vertices of the triangular mesh in global Cartesian coordinates. Each face is described by 3
%   points in 3D-space: [ v1x, v1y, v1z, v2x, v2y, v2z, v3x, v3y, v3z ]; singe or double precision;
%   Dimensions: [ n_triangles_in x 9 ]
%
%   n_div
%   Number of divisions per edge of the input mesh. The resulting number of faces is equal to
%   n_triangles_out = n_triangles_in Â· n_div^2
%
% Output:
%   triangles_out
%   Vertices of the sub-divided mesh in global Cartesian coordinates; singe or double precision;
%   Dimensions: [ n_triangles_out x 9 ]
