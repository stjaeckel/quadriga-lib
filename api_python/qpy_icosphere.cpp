# ICOSPHERE
Construct a geodesic polyhedron (icosphere), a convex polyhedron made from triangles

## Description:
An icosphere is constructed by subdividing faces of an icosahedron, a polyhedron with 20 faces,
12 vertices and 30 edges, and then projecting the new vertices onto the surface of a sphere. The
resulting mesh has 6 triangles at each vertex, except for 12 vertices which have 5 triangles.
The approximate equilateral triangles have roughly the same edge length and surface area.

## Usage:
```
from quadriga_lib import RTtools
center, length, vert, direction = RTtools.icosphere( no_div, radius, direction_xyz )
```

## Input Arguments:
- **`no_div`**<br>
  Number of divisions per edge of the generating icosahedron. The resulting number of faces is
  equal to `no_face = 20 Â· no_div^2`

- **`radius`**<br>
  Radius of the sphere in meters

- **`direction_xyz`**<br>
  Direction format indicator: 0 = Spherical (default), 1 = Cartesian


## Output Arguments (tuple containing 4 values):
- **`center`**<br>
  Position of the center point of each triangle; Shape: `( no_face, 3 )`

- **`length`**<br>
  Length of the vector pointing from the origin to the center point. This number is smaller than
  1 since the triangles are located inside the unit sphere; Shape: `( no_face )`

- **`vert`**<br>
  The 3 vectors pointing from the center point to the vertices of each triangle; the values are
  in the order `[ v1x, v1y, v1z, v2x, v2y, v2z, v3x, v3y, v3z ]`; Shape: `( no_face, 9 )`

- **`direction`**<br>
  The directions of the vertex-rays. If the format indicator `direction_xyz` is set to `0`, the
  output is in geographic coordinates (azimuth and elevation angle in rad); the values are in the
  order `( v1az, v1el, v2az, v2el, v3az, v3el ]`;Shape: `( no_face, 6 )` If the format indicator
  `direction_xyz` is set to `1`, the output is in Cartesian coordinates and the values are in the
  order `[ v1x, v1y, v1z, v2x, v2y, v2z, v3x, v3y, v3z  ]`; Shape: `( no_face, 9 )`
